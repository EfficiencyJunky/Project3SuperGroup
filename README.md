## SUMMARY
Write this as a brief summary of your interests and intent, including:  
### Problem / Motivation:  
There is data available on the planned time for muni arrival at stops, as well as live information as to when the muni is supposed to arrive, but itâ€™s difficult to plan in advance to see how likely the muni is to arrive ontime, or if late, how late?
### How it addresses the problem:
We intend to use the historical planned vs actual arrival times to examine the likelihood of ontime arrival (for a specific weekday, time of day, route and stop). In addition to providing some statistical information to the user (eg, in the last 3 months, trams arriving between 7am and 8am on the N-Line, at stop number _____, have, on average been 10 minutes late, with 68% of trams arriving between 2 and 14 minutes late, and 95% of trams arriving within 18 minutes of the scheduled arrival time), we will compile this information into a shame score.
### Possible source for such data:  
We intend to use the data from [511.org](http://511.org/)
